Parameter | Description | Range | Resolution | Typical value
Network hardware |  |  |  | 
Device ID | The device-id identifies the
equipment and will be assigned by
the factory. | 0 to 32767 | 1 | 32767
IP Address | If PASSIVE, then the IP address
will must be localhost and the TCP
port will be the port you want the
host to connect to. If ACTIVE, the
IP address will be the name or
dotted integer format IP address of
the host machine and the TCP port
will be the host port for the
equipment to connect to. |  |  | 127.0.0.1
TCP Port | The TCP port number. |  |  | 6000
Active or Passive | The equipment must be configured
to be a PASSIVE or ACTIVE
connection. Usually, a PASSIVE
connection is preferred for the
equipment side. | PASSIVE or
ACTIVE |  | PASSIVE
T3 | The T3 timeout is the transaction
timer. This is the maximum amount
of time between a primary message
and the expected response before
declaring the transaction closed. If
the timer expires, an S9F9 error
message is sent if AUTOS9F9 is
specified. | 1 – 120 seconds | 1 msec | 45 seconds
T5 | The T5 timeout is the connect
separation timeout. This is the
amount of time which must elapse
between successive attempts to
actively establish a connection. | 1 – 240 seconds | 1 msec | 5 seconds
T6 | The T6 timeout is the control
transaction timeout. This is the
maximum amount of time allowed
between an HSMS-level control
message and its response. If the
timer expires, communications
failure is declared. | 1 – 240 seconds | 1 msec | 5 seconds
T7 | The T7 timeout is the NOT
SELECTED timeout. This is the
maximum amount of time a TCP/IP
connection can remain in the NOT
SELECTED state (no HSMS
activity) before a communications
failure is declared. | 1 – 240 seconds | 1 msec | 10 seconds
T8 | The T8 timeout is the network
intercharacter timeout. This is the
maximum amount of time allowed
between successive bytes of a single | 1 – 120 seconds | 1 msec | 5 seconds
