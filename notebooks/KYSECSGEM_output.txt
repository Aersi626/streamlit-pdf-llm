1.7.2 Definitions
An alarm is related to any abnormal situation on the equipment that may endanger
Alarm people, equipment, or material being processed. Alarm notification may be disabled or
enabled. Each alarm is always either set or clear.
Capabilities are operations performed by semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
Capability These operations are initiated through the communications interface using sequences
of SECS-II messages.
A collection event is an event (or grouping of related events) on the equipment that is
Collection Event considered significant to the host. Event notification may be disabled or enabled as
desired. Data reports may be linked to events.
A communication failure is said to occur when an established communications link is
Communication Failure broken. In a SECS-I environment, this occurs when the protocol retry-limit (RTY) is
exceeded.
A communication fault occurs when the equipment does not receive an expected
Communication Fault
message, or when either a transaction timer or a conversation timer expires.
Information directly related to a collection event. The value is only guaranteed to be
Data Variable valid when included in a report linked to a valid collection event. A list of valid
collection events is included in the data variable's description in this manual.
Equipment Constant A machine setting. The host or local operator may set the value.
One or more reports linked to a collection event. The data in the report is sent in the
Event Report
same SECS-II message as the collection event notification.
This is used as a reference model for any type of equipment. It contains functionality
Generic Equipment Model that can apply to most equipment, but does not address unique requirements of specific
equipment.
Generic Model for Communications and Control of SEMI Equipment. SEMI E30.
GEM A standard implementation of the SECS-II standard defining a common set of

the arrow symbol at the new state. Transitions are unidirectional -- while the reverse transition may be possible, it is
considered a different transition with different conditions for initiation and different resultant actions.
States may be subdivided into substates to define more concise behavior. Thus, a hierarchy is defined whereby any
state may be a substate of some parent state and in turn be the parent of its own substates. Substates must be one of two
types, termed AND substates and OR substates.
A parent may be divided into two or more OR substates of which one and only one is the active substate at any time.
The accepted term for this exclusivity is XOR. For example, some system (perhaps a motor) has a state named
FUNCTIONAL. When the motor is FUNCTIONAL, it may be either ON or OFF, but never both.
Another way of dividing a parent state corresponds roughly to subsystems. These AND substates represent parallelism,
such that every AND substate of an active parent state is considered active. Harel also uses the term "Orthogonal
Component" to refer to AND substates. However, these parallel substates tend to be highly interactive and
interdependent. For this reason, the word orthogonal is considered confusing and has been excluded from use in this
document. Figure A.5.3, in the SEMI E30 manual, shows an example of AND substates representing (in part) an
automobile. Note the convention of attaching the name of the parent's state AUTOMOBILE to the outside of the state
in a small box. The substates shown are independent components and may have their own substates (of either the
"AND" or "OR" type):
• LIGHTS may be ON or OFF;
• DOOR may be OPEN or CLOSED;
• ENGINE is constructed of components such as pumps, pistons, carburetor, etc.
Exiting one of a set of AND substates requires the exit of all others. In some cases, a transition arrow will be shown
from only one of the substates with the others implied.
A simplification that also helps to prevent in determinacy is implemented with the symbol for default entry point. This
symbol will indicate which OR substate is initially active when there is not an explicit choice. A transition arrow from
one state to another that does not cross the boundary of the parent to point specifically to a substate indicates this lack
of specification.
An entrance to a state terminating in a history symbol indicates that the "OR" substate to be entered should be that
which was active the last time the parent state was active. For example, the last time the car was running the radio was
on. The history symbol H refers to the choice of substates of the parent. The symbol H* extends further to the lowest
level substates defined. In the absence of memory of a "last time", the default entry is used.
The selector and conditional selector symbols serve to abbreviate complex entrances to states. The meaning is similar
and indicates that the choice of OR substate upon entry of a parent state depends on some condition that is not shown.
The selector is usually used to combine several similar transition events, while the conditional selector will typically
require some computation or test of condition external to the stimulus for state transition. Please examine the
referenced article for more detail.
NOTE: Within the body of this document, the term statechart is not used in favor of the more traditional term state
diagram.
1.7.3.2 State Definitions
The state diagram provides a concise description of the function of a system. However, a full definition requires detail
that cannot be included on the diagram. A description of each state is required that covers the boundaries of the state
and any responses that occur within that state to the environment. The convention in this document is to provide state
names in ALL CAPS to help the reader identify where these are used. A sample state description of the "ON" state
might be:
ON
The switch is in the on position. Power is available to the motor. Speed of the motor will change in proportion to the
speed knob adjustment.
1.7.3.3 Transition Table
The last piece of the state model is the transition table. It consists of several columns that list the transition number
from the diagram, the starting and ending state for the transition, and three columns titled trigger, action, and comment.
The trigger column describes the combination of events and conditions that initiates the transition (e.g. Sx, Fy message
received). The trigger should be related to a single clearly defined event at the equipment. The action column identifies
the activities associated directly with the transition. These activities may be of three types: a) actions taken upon exit of
the old state, b) actions taken upon entry to the new state, and c) actions not associated with either state. These are not
differentiated in this document. The final column allows for additional comments that help to clarify the transition.
Table A.5, an example of a transition table, illustrates the motor example in Figure A.5.2 (shown in the SEMI E30
manual).

3 STATE MODELS
The following sections contain state models for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These state models describe
the behavior of the equipment from a host. GEM requires each state model to be documented with a state diagram, a
transition table and a definition of each system behavior when that state is active. Multiple host equipment must have
the same documented models for each host.
3.1 Communications
3.1.1 General Description
The Communications State Model defines the behavior of the equipment in relation to the existence or absence of a
communications link with the host. Two major states of SECS communication protocols are DISABLED and
ENABLED. The ENABLED state has two sub-states, NOT COMMUNICATING and COMMUNICATING.

3.1.3 State Definitions
3.1.3.1 DISABLED
The equipment does not desire SECS-II communication with a host computer. If the operator switches from
ENABLED to DISABLED, all SECS-II communications will cease immediately. Any unsent messages are discarded.
All further actions on any open transactions and conversations are terminated. Refer to SEMI E5 for definitions of
SECS-II transaction and conversation protocols. The DISABLED State may be the system default.
3.1.3.2 ENABLED
The equipment desires SECS-II communication with a host computer. ENABLED has two sub-states,
COMMUNICATING and NOT COMMUNICATING. Whenever communications are enabled, either during system
initialization or through operator selection, the sub-state of NOT COMMUNICATING is active until communications
are formally established. Lower-level protocols (such as SECS-I or HSMS-SS) are assumed to be functioning normally
in that they are capable of supporting the communication of SECS-II syntax. The ENABLED State may be the system
default.
3.1.3.3 NOT COMMUNICATING
Only messages S1, F13, S1, F14, and Stream 9 are sent while this sub-state is active. The equipment discards any
messages received from the host other than S1, F13 or S1, F14. The equipment will periodically attempt to establish
Equipment Name(s) Page 7 of 119

===== Page 15 =====

--- Text ---
Company SECS/GEM Documentation Revision Date
communication with the host computer by issuing an S1, F13 until communications are successfully established. Only
one equipment-initiated S1, F13 transaction is open at any time.
The NOT COMMUNICATING state has two sub-states, HOST-INITIATED CONNECT and EQUIPMENT-
INITIATED CONNECT. Both are active whenever the equipment is NOT COMMUNICATING. These sub-states
clarify the behavior of the equipment in the event that both the equipment and the host attempt to establish
communications during the same period of time. Note that in the Harel notation, an exit from any sub-state is an exit
from the parent state and thus from all other sub-states of that parent sub-state.
3.1.3.4 EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT
This state has two sub-states, WAIT CRA and WAIT DELAY. Upon any entry to the NOT COMMUNICATING State,
whenever EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT first becomes active, a transition to WAIT CRA occurs. The
CommDelay timer is then set to "expired," and an immediate attempt to send S1, F13 is made.
3.1.3.5 WAIT CRA
An establish-communications request has been sent. The equipment waits for the host to acknowledge the request.
3.1.3.6 WAIT DELAY
A connection-transaction failure has occurred. The CommDelay timer has been initialized. The equipment waits for the
timer to expire.
3.1.3.7 HOST-INITIATED CONNECT
This state describes the behavior of the equipment in response to a host-initiated S1, F13 while NOT
COMMUNICATING is active.
3.1.3.8 WAIT CR FROM HOST
This is a sub state of HOST-INITIATED CONNECT. The equipment waits for an S1, F13 from the host. If an S1, F13
is received, the equipment attempts to send an S1, F14 with COMMACK = 0.
3.1.3.9 COMMUNICATING
Communications have been established between the equipment and host. The equipment may receive any message
from the host, including S1, F13. When the equipment is COMMUNICATING, SECS communications with a host
computer must be maintained. This state remains active until communications are disabled or a communication failure
occurs. If the equipment receives S1, F13 from the host while in the COMMUNICATING sub-state, it should respond
with S1, F14 with COMMACK set to zero. If the equipment receives S1, F14 from a previously sent S1, F13, no action
is required.
In case of communication failure, the equipment returns to the NOT COMMUNICATING sub-state and attempts to re-
establish communications with the host.
It is possible that the equipment will be waiting for an S1, F14 from the host in EQUIPMENT-INITIATED
CONNECT/WAIT CRA when an S1, F13 is received from the host in HOST-INITIATED CONNECT/WAIT CR
FROM HOST. When this situation occurs, both equipment and host have an open S1, F13/S1, F14 transaction. Since
communications are successfully established on the favorable completion of any S1, F13/S1, F14 transaction, either of
these two transactions may be the first to complete successfully and to cause the transition from NOT
COMMUNICATING to COMMUNICATING. In this event, the other transaction remains open regardless of the
transition to COMMUNICATING until it is closed in a normal manner.
If the equipment has not yet sent an S1, F14 to a previously received S1, F13 at the time when COMMUNICATING
becomes active, the S1, F14 response is sent in a normal manner. This includes transmissions that may have started but
not yet successfully completed at the time that the transition to COMMUNICATING occurs. A failure to send the S1,
F14 is then treated as any other communication failure.
If the equipment-initiated S1, F13/S1, F14 transaction is still open when the transition to COMMUNICATING occurs,
then a subsequent failure to receive a reply from the host is considered a communication fault by equipment. An S9, F9
is sent when a transaction timer timeout occurs.

3.2 Control
3.2.1 General Description
The Control State Model defines the level of cooperation between the host and equipment. This model also specifies
how the operator may interact at the different levels of host control and defines the equipment’s responsibility to act
upon messages that it receives. Three levels of control exist. The highest level, REMOTE, allows the host to control the
equipment to the full extent possible. The middle level, LOCAL, allows the host to access all information, but places
some limitations on how the host may control equipment operation. The lowest level, OFF-LINE, allows no host
control and no access.

When the OFF-LINE State is active, the operator at the operator console only performs operation of the equipment.
Message transfer is severely restricted. The equipment will respond with an Sx, F0 to any primary message from the
host other than S1, F13 or S1, F17. It will process and respond to S1, F13 (establishment of communications) and S1,
F17 (host request to activate the ON-LINE State). The equipment will accept the S1, F17 and send a positive response
only when the HOST OFF-LINE state is active (see transition 11 in the Control State Transition Table).
While the OFF-LINE State is active, the equipment will not send any primary messages other than S1, F13, S9, Fx, and
S1, F1 (see ATTEMPT ON-LINE sub-state). Sending of S1, F13 is based upon the COMMUNICATIONS State
Model. S9, Fx messages is issued only in response to the messages to which the equipment will normally respond while
OFF-LINE (i.e., S1, F13 and S1, F17). If the equipment receives a reply message from the host other than S1, F14 or
S1, F2, this message is discarded.
No messages enter the spool when the system is OFF-LINE. Spooling may be active when the Communications State
of NOT COMMUNICATING is active. This might occur during OFF-LINE, but since the equipment will not attempt
to send messages except as mentioned in the previous paragraph, no messages will enter the spool. The equipment may
send S1, F1 or S1, F13, but since Stream 1 messages are not eligible for spooling, they will not enter the spool.
OFF-LINE has three sub-states: EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE, ATTEMPT ON-LINE, and HOST OFF-LINE.
3.2.3.2 EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE
While this state is active, the system maintains the OFF-LINE State. It awaits operator instructions to attempt to go
ON-LINE.
3.2.3.3 ATTEMPT ON-LINE
While the ATTEMPT ON-LINE State is active, the equipment has responded to an operator instruction to attempt to go
to the ON-LINE State. Upon activating this state, the equipment attempts to send an S1, F1 to the host. Note that when
this state is active, the system does not respond to operator actuation of either the ON-LINE or the OFF-LINE switch.
3.2.3.4 HOST OFF-LINE
While the HOST OFF-LINE state is active, the operator's intent is that the equipment be ON-LINE. However, the host
has not agreed. Entry to this state may be due to a failed attempt to go ON-LINE or to the host's request that the
equipment go OFF-LINE from ON-LINE (see the Control State Transition Table for more detail). While this state is
active, the equipment positively responds to any host's request to go ON-LINE (S1, F17). Such a request is denied
when the HOST OFF-LINE State is not active.

3.2.3.5 ON-LINE
While the ON-LINE State is active, SECS-II messages may be exchanged and active. Capabilities available to the host
are similar to those available from the operator console wherever practical. The equipment may go ON-LINE only
when the Communication State is COMMUNICATING.
3.2.3.6 LOCAL
Operation of the equipment is implemented by direct action of an operator. All operation commands are available for
input at the local operator console of the equipment.
The host has the following capabilities and restrictions when the LOCAL State is active:
• During processing, the host may be prohibited from modifying equipment constants that affect that process. Other
equipment constants are changeable during processing. The host may modify all available equipment constants
when no processing is in progress.
• The host is prohibited from the use of remote commands.
• The host may initiate the upload and download of recipes to or from the recipe storage area on the equipment
unless it affects the current recipe during processing.
• The host may configure automatic data reporting capabilities including alarms, event reporting, and trace data
reporting. The host receives all such reports at the appropriate times.
• The host may inquire for data from the equipment, including status data, equipment constants, event reports,
process program directories, and alarms.
• The equipment may perform Terminal Services.
The host is allowed any other capabilities that were not specifically restricted in the above items as long as the LOCAL
State is active.
Note: Capabilities mentioned above which are not implemented on a specific equipment may be ignored in this
context.
3.2.3.7 REMOTE
While the REMOTE State is active, the host may operate the equipment through the communications interface. All
functionality allowed during the LOCAL State is also allowed in the REMOTE State. The equipment does not restrict
any host capabilities when REMOTE is active. The host may issue remote commands according to each command's
availability. No capabilities that are available to the operator during LOCAL control are unconditionally restricted
when the REMOTE State is active.
Control is shared between the host and the local operator. At the very least, the operator may change the CONTROL
State, actuate an Emergency Stop, and interrupt processing. The host software should be designed to be compatible
with the capabilities allotted to the operator.
Remote commands are listed and described in the Appendix.

3.4 Limits Monitoring
3.4.1 General Description
The Limits Monitoring State Model allows the equipment to monitor certain status and data variable values. It allows
the host to define limit boundaries. The equipment notifies the host using a collection event whenever configured
variables transition across limit boundaries.
The limits monitoring capability provides the host a means of monitoring equipment conditions by a flexible, efficient
and asynchronous method which is consistent across equipment. It eliminates the need for frequent status variable
polling. This capability also allows the host to implement changes in the monitoring range as needed. This capability
has application to both production operation and diagnostic/testing scenarios and it has applicability to statistical
process control.
Limits monitoring may be configured for each available variable according to this diagram.

Notice that each limit has an upper dead-band and lower dead-band value. The region between the two is called the
dead-band. If the upper and lower dead-band values are equal, then there is no dead-band. The regions above and below
the limit are called zones. A zone transition occurs when the value crosses above the upper dead-band or below the
lower dead-band. The host may define as many limits as desired.
UPPERDB and LOWERDB values are restricted by the following formula:
Limit Maximum ≥ UPPERDB ≥ LOWERDB ≥ Limit Minimum
A limit divides the possible range of variable values into two parts, the upper zone and the lower zone. At any time, the
monitored variable is considered to be in one and only one of these zones. However, as Figure 4.2.2 in the SEMI E30
manual shows, these two zones have an area of overlap. This is called the dead-band.
The dead-band is a critical element of Limits Monitoring. Its purpose is to prevent a phenomenon known as chattering -
- the repeated changing of zones due to small, rapid fluctuations in variable value while near the zone boundary. In
practice, the value of a variable must reach the opposite boundary of the dead-band before a zone transition can occur.
Thus, if a variable's value reaches the UPPERDB and transitions into the upper zone, it will not return to the lower zone
until it falls back to the LOWERDB. The difference between UPPERDB and LOWERDB should always be greater
than the typical amplitude of those fluctuations deemed insignificant. In some cases, the width of the dead-band may
set to zero (i.e., UPPERDB = LOWERDB). At first glance, this would seem to make indeterminate the current zone
when an integer value sits on the limit. This is not the case, however, when movement of the value is considered. To
illustrate, an example is given, assuming that UPPERDB = LOWERDB = 100.
Transition from one zone into another generates a collection event, as might be reported via S6, F11. The host has the
option of receiving notification by enabling event reporting for the event. For each variable that has monitoring
capability, one CEID is reserved to indicate zone transitions for that variable.
The sampling frequency is an important aspect of Limits Monitoring. If the value changes frequently compared to
sampling frequency, it is possible for some zone transitions to be missed or for multiple zone transitions to occur
between readings. Since it is possible for zone transitions to occur “simultaneously” and for limit boundaries to be
identical, the "event limit" data variable allows a list of multiple zone transitions of a variable to be reported with a
single collection event.

3.4.3 Limits Monitoring State Definitions Table
3.4.3.1 ABOVE LIMIT
A variable is considered to be above a limit when its value increases to equal or exceed the upper boundary of the dead-
band, UPPERDB. The significance attached to this state is a function of the host's usage.
3.4.3.2 BELOW LIMIT
A variable is considered to be below a limit when its value decreases to equal or fall below the lower boundary of the
dead-band, LOWERDB. The significance attached to this state is a function of the host's usage.
3.4.3.3 NO ZONE
In some circumstances, it is possible for the variable value to be in neither the upper zone nor the lower zone. This may
occur upon definition of a new limit or upon equipment startup when the value of the variable lies in the dead-band. In
this case, the active state of the limit is considered NO ZONE. The limit remains in this state until the variable value
reaches either boundary of the dead-band.

3.5 Alarms
3.5.1 General Description
The alarm management capability provides for host notification and management of alarm conditions occurring on the
equipment. This alarm management provides several useful tools.
• Reporting the time of an alarm state change.
• Uploading a list of alarm texts.
• Enabling and disabling the notification of specific alarms.
• Host query of alarms set and enabled status on the equipment.
An alarm is related to any abnormal situation on the equipment that may endanger people, equipment, or material being
processed. Such abnormal situations are defined by the equipment manufacturer based on physical safety limitations.
Equipment activities potentially impacted by the presence of an alarm are inhibited. Note that exceeding control limits
associated with process tolerance do not constitute an alarm nor do normal equipment events such as the start or
completion of processing.

3.6 Spooling
3.6.1 General Description
Spooling allows the equipment to queue messages intended for the host during times of unexpected communication
failure and subsequently deliver these messages when communication is restored. Spooling is limited to primary
messages of host-selected streams and functions.
The purpose of spooling is to provide a method for retaining equipment message data that might otherwise be lost due
to communication failure. The motive for producing this functionality is to retain valuable data used to track material
and to improve product quality. The spooling capability fills a gap in the SEMI E5 standard. In the past, without a
spooling capability, equipment has typically discarded messages that could not be delivered, or turned messaging off
altogether. It is intended that the host initiate the spool unload process immediately following the reestablishment of
communications.

3.6.3.3 SPOOL INACTIVE
This is the normal operating mode. No spooling occurs. The spool area is empty. Primary SECS-II messages are
transmitted normally.
3.6.3.4 SPOOL ACTIVE
All primary SECS-II messages ready for sending and for which spooling is enabled (see S2, F43) are directed to the
spool area. All other primary messages, except Stream 1, are discarded. The equipment attempts to send any generated
secondary messages, yet discards them if the attempt to send fails.

Company SECS/GEM Documentation Revision Date
Once communications are established, the host must initiate the spool unload sequence to restore full functionality (see
below). Since the equipment will deliver secondary messages, the host may inquire for information or send commands
as needed.
The SPOOL ACTIVE State has two substates, SPOOL LOAD and SPOOL UNLOAD. This means that they operate
independently, though sharing data and some state change stimuli.
3.6.3.5 SPOOL LOAD
The SPOOL LOAD component enters messages into the spool area. It is divided into two substates: SPOOL NOT
FULL and SPOOL FULL. SPOOL NOT FULL is the default entry substate of the parent state SPOOL LOAD.
3.6.3.6 SPOOL NOT FULL
As primary SECS-II messages are directed to the spool area, the equipment "writes" the SECS-II message to the end of
the spool. Spooling status variables are incremented each time a message is placed in the spool area.
3.6.3.7 SPOOL FULL
In this state, all of the allocated spooling area is filled. The following options are equipment constant controlled. The
first message to be dealt with is that which could not be fit into the spool prior to transition from SPOOL NOT FULL
(see transition table below).
If the "OverWriteSpool" equipment constant is true and the spool is full, then the equipment will delete the “oldest”
record (e.g. SECS-II message) contained in the spool area to make space before adding the new message. The
"SpoolCountTotal" status variable is incremented whenever a message is submitted to the spool area. The
"SpoolCountActual" status variable is manipulated to keep an accurate count of the number of messages contained in
the spool area.
If the "OverWriteSpool" equipment constant is false, then the subsequent primary messages are discarded. When such a
message is discarded, the "SpoolCountTotal" SV is still incremented, and the “SpoolCountActual” remains unchanged.
3.6.3.8 SPOOL UNLOAD
The SPOOL UNLOAD component of SPOOLACTIVE deals with movement of messages out of the spool. It has an
active substate (SPOOL OUTPUT) and a passive substate (NO SPOOL OUTPUT). NO SPOOL OUTPUT is the
default entry substate since the equipment is NOT COMMUNICATING at the time spooling is initiated. When
communications between equipment and host are restored, there is an opportunity for the host to recover spooled
messages. No action is taken until the host initiates the spool output process via the S6, F23 (Request Spooled Data).
The host has the option to either receive the spooled messages (see substate TRANSMIT SPOOL) or discard all
messages in the spool (see substate PURGE SPOOL).
3.6.3.9 NO SPOOL OUTPUT
In this state, no messages are removed from the spool.
3.6.3.10 SPOOL OUTPUT
The SPOOL OUTPUT State encompasses the removal of messages from the spool. Its substates are TRANSMIT
SPOOL and PURGE SPOOL.
3.6.3.11 TRANSMIT SPOOL
The host elects to receive all messages contained in the spool area. The equipment is expected to keep track of the
oldest record (i.e. message) within the spool area. When communications are re-established with the host and
transmission of the spool area is started, the oldest record is the first record transmitted then the next oldest record, etc.
There is no prioritization of messages to be sent from the spool.
As each spooled message is successfully transmitted to the host, it is removed from the spool area upon successful
completion of the transaction. The "SpoolCountActual" SV is decremented as each message is removed from the spool.
The equipment transmits messages only from the spool area until all spooled messages have been completely
transmitted to the host.
Flow control of the spool transmit process is achieved in two ways. First, only one open transaction on the equipment is
allowed during spool unload. Thus, if a message requires a reply, the equipment waits for that reply before transmitting
the next spooled message. Messages that require no reply are transmitted sequentially as rapidly as the message transfer
mechanism will allow.
The second flow control method is to allow the host to limit the maximum number of messages sent from the spool in
response to the S6, F23 request. The "MaxSpoolTransmit" equipment constant may be set by the host to achieve this
behavior. If set to five, for example, the equipment will send the first five messages from the spool and then transition
to the NO SPOOL OUTPUT State, awaiting the nextS6, F23 request. There is no event report generated when the
"maximum spool transmit" value is reached. The host is responsible for determining this situation by one of the
following:
Equipment Name(s) Page 20 of 119

===== Page 28 =====

--- Text ---
Company SECS/GEM Documentation Revision Date
• counting the messages received
• timing out waiting for the next message
• inquiring to the equipment for the current value of the "SpoolCountActual" SV
• some combination of the above
If the "MaxSpoolTransmit" equipment constant is set to zero, the spool is transmitted completely in response to S6,
F23.
Normal spooling continues during the spool transmit process. If the SPOOL LOAD component transitions to SPOOL
FULL, it does not have any effect on the SPOOL UNLOAD component. Once full, the spool cannot make the
transition back to SPOOL NOT FULL except via the SPOOL INACTIVE State. Space made available due to the spool
unload process is not used in this case.
When a multi-block message is to be transmitted from the spool, any required inquire/grant transaction is initiated. If
the host's response denies permission to send the multi-block message, the equipment discards that message and
continues with the transmit process. This sequence counts as one message in the "maximum spool transmit" EC count.
SPOOL LOAD and SPOOL UNLOAD may interact when the spool is full and "OverwriteSpool" EC is True. During
the spool transmission process, spooled messages are removed while new primary messages are written to the spool.
These new messages are overwriting the oldest messages available, unless the process of unloading has made sufficient
spool space available. There is a possibility that unloading and overwriting processes may compete for control of the
same message area. The loss of continuity may be "disorienting" to the host program receiving the messages. It is
expected that the unloading process will be fast relative to the generation of new messages, so this occurrence will be
rare.
Should a communication failure occur during the spool transmit process, spooling continues as before the transmit
process began. However, the spool unload sequence terminates (i.e. transition to NO SPOOL OUTPUT will occur--see
transition table below).
3.6.3.12 PURGE SPOOL
The equipment discards all messages in the spool and, when the spool is empty, "SpoolCountActual" SV becomes zero.

4 MACHINE CAPABILITIES
4.1 Establish Communications
4.1.1 Purpose
Communications between host and equipment are formally established through use of the Establish Communications
Request/Establish Communications Acknowledge transaction, S1, F13/F14.
4.1.2 Description
There are potential problems when one side of the communications link fails and the other side does not detect it. From
the point of view of the host, a loss of communications has many possible causes. In some cases, host-controlled
settings on the equipment may need to be reset. In other cases, the equipment may have continued an automatic
processing sequence during the period of no communication and may have changed states.
The equipment considers communications as formally established whenever either of the following conditions has been
satisfied. Satisfaction of either of these conditions will result in a transition to the COMMUNICATING sub-state. See
the Communications State Model for further detail.
• Communications Request has been sent to the host and an Establish Communications Acknowledge has been
received within the transaction timeout period and with an acknowledge code of "Accept", or
• Communications Request has been received from the host, and an Establish Communications Acknowledge
response has been successfully sent with an acknowledge code of "Accept."
When the equipment is attempting to establish communications, an Establish Communications Request is sent
periodically until communications have been formally established as described above. The interval between attempts is
user-configurable and begins as soon as a connection transaction failure is detected (see Communications State Model).
Attempting to establish communications is not a low-level connectivity issue, but rather a logical application issue used
by either party to notify its partner that the host may need to perform synchronization activities with the equipment.

4.1.3.3 Simultaneous Attempts to Establish Communications
For equipment that supports interleaving, it is possible that either the host or equipment could send an Establish
Communications Request before receiving the request from its partner. As communications are established by the
successful acceptance of any one Establish Communications Request, it is immaterial who sends the request first. The
roles of host and equipment may be reversed.

4.2 Dynamic Event Report Configuration
4.2.1 Purpose
This capability provides the data reporting flexibility required in some manufacturing environments. It
allows the host to increase or decrease the data flow according to need. For example, if the performance of
the equipment degrades, the data flow from that equipment may be increased to help diagnose the problem.
4.2.2 Detailed Description
The equipment supports the following event report configuration functionality through the SECS-II interface:
• Host definition/deletion of custom reports,
• Host linking/unlinking of defined reports to specified collection events, and
• Host enabling/disabling the reporting of specified collection events.

Note: The equipment may also supply alternative means for defining reports and linking reports to events (e.g. via
the operator console). Implementation of alternate means is not required.
The equipment can be instructed by the host to enable or disable reporting of collection events on an individual or
collective basis. A status variable (SV) is available that consists of a list of enabled collection events.
Reports may be attached to an event report message (S6, F11). These reports are linked to the desired collection event.
They typically contain variables relating to that event. The reported data in the event report messages might include
status variables (SV), equipment constants (EC), or data variables (DV). Note that data variable values are only valid
upon certain events and should be included only in reports linked to those events.

4.5 Trace Data Collection
4.5.1 Purpose
Trace data collection provides a method of sampling data on a periodic basis. The time-based approach to data
collection is useful in tracking trends or repeated applications within a time window, or monitoring of continuous data.
4.5.2 Detailed Description
The equipment establishes a trace report as instructed by the host (S2, F23). For a trace report (S6, F1) the host
designates the following:
• Trace report identifier (TRID)
• Time interval for data sampling (DSPER)
• Total number of samples to be taken (TOTSMP)
• Number of samples per trace report (REPGSZ)
• Listing of which data will be sent with the report
The number of trace reports sent to the host is determined by total samples, divided by reporting group size
(TOTSMP/REPGSZ).
The equipment samples the specified data at the interval designated by the host (DSPER) and sends a predefined trace
report to the host for the specified reporting group size (REPGSZ). The trace report definition is automatically deleted
from the equipment after the last trace report has been sent.
The host may modify or re-initiate a trace function currently in progress by specifying the same TRID in a trace request
definition. At this point, the old trace is terminated and the new trace is initiated. The host may also instruct the
equipment to terminate a trace report prior to its completion by specifying TOTSMP = 0 for that TRID, at which point
the trace definition is deleted.

4.6 Status Data Collection
4.6.1 Purpose
This capability allows the host to query the equipment for selected status information and is useful in synchronizing
with equipment status.
4.6.2 Detailed Description
The host may query equipment status by specifying the desired SVID. Upon such a request, the equipment sends the
host the value of the selected status variables. The host also may request the description (name and units) of any or all
status variables.

4.7 Alarm Management
4.7.1 Purpose
Historically, a precise definition of an equipment alarm has been absent. Consequently, differing interpretations have
resulted in inconsistent implementations. This is addressed by providing a more rigorous alarm definition.
In addition, it is often important for equipment to report more extensive information to the host than has been available
in the S5, F1/F2 (Alarm Report Send/Acknowledge) transaction. The data required in such cases is very dependent on
equipment type, host information requirements, and alarm situation. This issue is addressed by providing event-
reporting methods that are tied to alarm state changes.
Lastly, the alarm management capability provides mechanisms for the following.
• Reporting the time of an alarm state change
• Uploading a list of alarm texts
• Enabling and disabling the notification of specific alarms
• Host query of alarms set and enabled status on the equipment
4.7.2 Detailed Description
Two alarm notification mechanisms are defined to achieve the flexibility necessary for the reporting required by host
systems. First, stream 5 alarm reporting enables a brief, yet fixed, method for notification of alarm occurrences using

the S5, F1/F2 transaction. Second, two collection events (a “Set” and “Clear” event) are defined for each alarm defined
on the equipment to allow the use of event data collection mechanisms. This addresses the hosts’ potential need for
more extensive and flexible data reporting. In the latter case, reports are sent by the equipment using the Event
Report/Acknowledge transaction (refer to Event Data Collection).
In the Alarm State model, the transition from the ALARM CLEAR to the ALARM SET state (transition 1) will trigger
the set event for the alarm. Conversely, the transition from ALARM SET to ALARM CLEAR state (transition 2) will
trigger the clear event.
NOTE: The alarm capability is intended as an addition to standard safety alarms (e.g. lights, horns, etc.). There is no
intent to replace direct operator notification of such problems, nor is there the expectation that the host can prevent or
directly address such alarms.
4.7.2.1 Differences Between Events and Alarms
EVENT ALARM
An event is any occurrence detectable by the equipment. An alarm is related to only those occurrences that are
abnormal, undesirable, AND endanger people, equipment,
or physical material being processed.
Certain events may trigger a state transition(s). Each alarm has an associated two-state state model:
ALARM SET (or unsafe) and ALARM CLEAR (or safe).
Equipment activities are not necessarily inhibited by the The presence of an alarm inhibits equipment activities to
occurrence of an event (unless it is associated with an ensure safe operation until the alarm condition is cleared.

4.8.2 Description
The equipment responds to host commands that provide the following functions relative to individual equipment
implementations:
• Start processing
• Select a process program
• Stop processing
• Temporarily suspend processing
• Resume processing
• Abort processing
Remote commands are interpreted as "request action be initiated" rather than "do action." The equipment may then
respond via S2, F42 with HCACK = 4 if the command "is going to be performed." This alleviates any transaction
timeouts for commands that may take a long time to perform. The completion of the action initiated by the remote
command (i.e., HCACK = 0 or 4) must result in either a state transition or other action that generates a collection event
upon normal/abnormal completion.
The format for all remote commands is ASCII, with a maximum length of 20 characters. The character set is restricted
to the printable characters (hexadecimal 21 through 7E). Note that spaces are not allowed.
A detailed list of supported remote commands is provided in the “Remote Commands” section.

4.10 Process Program Management
4.10.1 Purpose
Process program management provides a means to transfer process programs and to share the management of those
process programs between the host and equipment.
4.10.2 Description
A process program is the pre-planned and reusable set of instructions, settings, and parameters that determine the
processing environment seen by the manufactured object. Process programs are also called recipes. It might be changed
between runs and processing cycles.
Process programs allow the equipment's process, and/or the parameters used by that process, to be set and modified by
the engineer to achieve different results. Different process programs may be required for different products, while often
the same process program will be used for all lots of a given product. The engineer must be able to create such
programs, to modify current programs, and to delete programs from equipment storage.
For the host to ensure that the proper process programs are on the equipment, there must be a means of transferring
them from equipment to host and from host to equipment. The host also may need to delete process programs from the
equipment's storage to make room for a process program to be downloaded. In addition, the host must be kept informed
whenever a local change occurs in the contents or status of a process program.
Unformatted process programs may be uploaded and downloaded. This capability provides for both host- and
equipment-initiated transfers. The equipment-initiated transfer may be used at the request of the process engineer or
operator of the equipment. This machine only supports unformatted process programs.
If a process program exists with the same PPID as the one given in the SECS-II message, the old process program will
be replaced. The PPID in the SECS-II message is used to identify the process program in non-volatile storage.
The equipment may deny overwriting or deleting a recipe if it is in use or affects the recipe in use.

The clock capability enables time stamping of collection event and alarm reports. Time stamping is useful for resolving
relative order of event/alarm occurrences and scheduling of equipment activities by the host.
The ability for the host to instruct the equipment to set an internal clock to a specified time value, and for the
equipment to request the current date and time, is needed for effective time management and synchronization.
4.13.2 Detailed Description
The clock capability assumes the existence of a relative time reference on the equipment. This time reference is used as
a basis for updating the time value of an equipment status variable called "Clock." The time reference must reflect the
current time to within a resolution range of seconds to centiseconds (refer to the format for Clock in the SEMI E5

Standard). The purpose of time stamping with centiseconds is to resolve the order in which nearly simultaneous events
occur rather than to provide a more precise record of the time of day at which they occurred. Where more than one
event occurs within a given period of clock resolution, the centiseconds reported in the event time stamps must reflect
the actual order that the events were detected. Equipment with a clock resolution of less than a second should report
centiseconds. Otherwise, centiseconds should be assigned to reflect the relative order in which events were detected.
Equipment unable to resolve time to less than a second and unable to reflect the relative order in which events were
detected may report centiseconds as "00."
The host employs the "Date and Time Set Request" message (S2, F31) to initialize the value of Clock to the value
contained in the TIME data item. Similarly, the equipment may employ the "Date and Time Request" message (S2,
F17) to obtain a new initialization time for Clock. As before, the value of TIME returned by the host is used to set
Clock. Note that since the precision of TIME is seconds and that for Clock is centiseconds, in both cases the initial
value of Clock contains "00" for its centisecond digits upon initialization.

4.14.1 Purpose
The limits monitoring capability provides the host a means of monitoring equipment conditions by a flexible, efficient
and asynchronous method which is consistent across equipment. The host might avoid polling status values. Further,
this capability allows the host to implement changes in the monitoring range as needed. This capability has application
to both production operation and diagnostic/testing scenarios. It also might be applied to statistical process control.

4.15 Spooling
4.15.1 Purpose
Spooling provides a method for retaining equipment message data that might otherwise be lost due to
communication failure. The motive for producing this functionality is to retain valuable data used to track
material and to improve product quality. The spooling capability fills a gap in the SEMI E5 standard. In the
past, without a spooling capability, the equipment has typically discarded messages that could not be
delivered, or turned messaging off altogether. It is intended that the host initiate the spool unload process
immediately following the reestablishment of communications.
4.15.2 Description - Enabling Spooling
The equipment provides the host with the ability to enable and disable Spooling for any message (except
Stream 1 messages, i.e. S1, F1 and S1, F13) via the S2, F43/F44 transaction. Spooling may be enabled for
an entire Stream, for individual messages within a stream, or for any combination of the two. Streams and
Functions not referenced in this message are not spooled. Spooling can be totally disabled by sending an
S2, F43 with a zero length list for the first item (see S2, F43 definition).
The Spooling State Machine is described in section 3.6.

4.16 Control (Host-Initiated)
4.16.1 Purpose
This section complements the Control State Model description found in section 3.2. It defines the requirements for
implementation of this model.
4.16.2 Description Control Configuration
The control state model has two areas of configuration. The first area is related to the default entry states of the state
model. Upon system initialization, the system must activate either the ON-LINE or the OFF-LINE state. Upon entry to
OFF-LINE, the system must in turn activate one of the substates of OFF-LINE (EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE, ATTEMPT
ON-LINE, or HOST OFF-LINE). In both these cases, the user configures the equipment to make the choices
appropriate to that factory. Entry to the ON-LINE state also involves a choice of substates. In this case, the equipment
reads the front panel REMOTE/LOCAL switch to determine the appropriate state.
The second area of configuration involves the transition to be made if the ON-LINE attempt should fail. The model
may be set to transition to either HOST OFF-LINE or to EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE should the S1, F1 transaction be

terminated unsuccessfully. Choosing HOST OFF-LINE allows the host to cause the equipment to transition to ON-
LINE when the host becomes ready. This is accomplished via the message S1, F17 (see below).
4.16.2.1 Changing Control State
In the control state model, both the operator and the host can affect the control state. The operator retains ultimate
authority to set the equipment OFF-LINE by means of an OFF-LINE switch mechanism. The operator also can cause
the equipment to attempt to go ON-LINE. Under some circumstances, the host can initiate the transition to ON-LINE.
If the operator requests to go ON-LINE, the equipment will send an S1, F1 to the host. The host may confirm ON-
LINE with an S1, F2 or deny ON-LINE by sending an S1, F0. If there is no host response (i.e., reply timeout), the
equipment treats it as a denial.
When the equipment is ON-LINE, the host may request that it transition to OFF-LINE. It transitions to the HOST OFF-
LINE substate. When the equipment HOST OFF-LINE state is active, the host may request that it transition to ON-
LINE. The combination of these two allows the host to cycle the equipment between ON-LINE and OFF-LINE.
Only the operator may change the ON-LINE substate (REMOTE or LOCAL).

7 STREAMS AND FUNCTIONS
The sections below describe the subset of SECS-II message streams and their included functions that are supported by
the interface. It can be seen that the odd numbered functions within each stream are requests and the subsequent, even
numbered functions are the corresponding response.

8.1.4 Host Connection Specific
Usually all GEM host interfaces are created using the identical setup. However, there are cases where host
interfaces are unique.
You may want to restrict the functionality of some host interfaces. For example, you may want to allow
only one host interface to perform process program management (recipe management). GEM features can
be disabled for a host by configuring the connection-specific Well Known variables.
You also may want to provide features for one host interface that are not available to others. For example,
you may want to create a host interface for your line controller and provide internal events and data that are
not exposed to the manufacturer. You may create connection-specific variables, equipment constants, and
collection events that are not available to other host interfaces.
