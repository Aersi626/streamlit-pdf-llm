4031 | S6MultiBlockInquire | Bo | EC | Bo 0 | Bo 1 | Bo 0 | Enable or disable the usage of S6F5
multi-block inquire (MBI) messages.
1=send MBI 0=don't send MBI.
4032 | SpoolingWaitDelayActivation | U1 | EC | U1 0 | U1 2 | U1 0 | 0=Spooling is not activated when the
WAIT CRA to WAIT DELAY
communication state machine
transition occurs; 1=Spooling is
activated anytime the WAIT CRA to
WAIT DELAY communication state
machine transition occurs and
spooling is enabled (this establishes
strict compliance with E30);
2=Spooling is activated after the
second WAIT CRA to WAIT
DELAY communication state
machine trasition (this allows the
host time to establish communication
without aggressively activating
spooling).
4036 | ExtendedTimeFormat | U1 | EC | U1 0 | U1 1 | U1 0 | The format applied to report time
values when TimeFormat EC is 2.
0=UTC (default setting; PV2
compliant); 1=local time with time
zone offset.
301005 | VariableReportingStyle | U4 | EC | U4 0 | U4
4294967295 | U4 0 | S1F3 and S2F23 VID tolerance
where 0 = Strict compliance with
SEMI standards where only SVID
are allowed; 1 = Allow any variable
type (SV; DV; or EC) to be reported.
301008 | TraceReportMultiBlock | U4 | EC | U4 0 | U4
4294967295 | U4 1 | Allow Trace Reports with total data
size that is larger than 244 bytes (0 =
do not allow large reports. 1[default]
= allow large trace reports). It is
recommended to leave this at U4 1.
Set to 0 to help avoid unintentional
performance degradation from trace
reports larger than 244 bytes.
301010 | SpoolingActivatedEventOption1 | U1 | EC | U1 0 | U1 255 | U1 1 | Options for sending
SpoolingActivated GEM Collection
Event (0=trigger event when the
Spooling state changes to ACTIVE;
1=trigger event before any queued
messages have been spooled).
301013 | SupportPV2 | U1 | EC | U1 0 | U1 255 | U1 0 | 0 = default behavior - GEM
functionality; 1 = enable PV2
behavior. Causes CIMConnect not to
send Event reports for Set/Clear
Alarm events if the Alarm is not
enabled.
